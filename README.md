    526: Unraveling the racial disparity in preterm birth: experiences of discrimination are associated with preterm birth and low birth weight in black women https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(10)01804-1/fulltext
  </summary> 
  
> A prospective cohort study of women with a singleton pregnancy who presented between 22-33 6/7 weeks for signs of preterm labor was examined. Black race was identified through self-report. EOD as a child (CEOD) or adult (AEOD) in 9 situations and response to unfair treatment (UT) due to “race or skin color” was assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination validated instrument. CEOD and AEOD were each scored from 0-9 reflecting the number of situations in which discrimination was experienced. UT was scored 0-2; 0 was the most passive and 2 was the most active response to UT. **Associations between the exposures and PTB and low birth weight (LBW< 2500g) were analyzed** using chi square analyses and fisher's exact tests. MVLR was used to control for confounders.

> Of 325 women enrolled, we analyzed the 262 who self-identified as black. 57% of women report at least one EOD as a child and 47% report at least one EOD as an adult. AEOD was associated with PTB (p=0.026), whereas **CEOD was associated with LBW (p=0.012)**. Additionally, patient response to UT was associated with both PTB (p<0.001) and LBW (p=0.009). Specifically, those who are intermediate or non committal in their response to UT (score 1) have the highest risk of PTB after controlling for insurance and prenatal care. Those who are the most passive (score 0) have the lowest PTB risk (Table).

(NOTE: I included this source to illustrate how non-physiological factors can contribute to outcomes such as low birth weight and also potentially contribute toward neonatal mortality, suggesting that these seemingly unrelated factors could pose as confounders for the relationship between smoking and neonatal mortality)

    Association between Short Maternal Height and Low Birth Weight: a Hospital-based Study in Japan https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779858/)
  </summary> 

> Anthropometry measurements, such as height and weight, have recently been used to predict poorer birth outcomes. However, the relationship between maternal height and birth outcomes remains unclear. We examined the effect of shorter maternal height on low birth weight (LBW) among 17,150 pairs of Japanese mothers and newborns. Data for this analysis were collected from newborns who were delivered at a large hospital in Japan. Maternal height was the exposure variable, and LBW and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit were the outcome variables. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations. **The shortest maternal height quartile (131.0–151.9 cm) was related to LBW (OR 1.91 [95% CI 1.64, 2.22]). The groups with the second (152.0–157.9 cm) and the third shortest maternal height quartiles (158.0–160.9 cm) were also related to LBW.** A P trend with one quartile change also showed a significant relationship. The relationship between maternal height and NICU admission disappeared when the statistical model was adjusted for LBW. A newborn’s small size was one factor in the relationship between shorter maternal height and NICU admission. **In developed countries, shorter mothers provide a useful prenatal target to anticipate and plan for LBW newborns and NICU admission.**

    Commentary: Resolutions of the birthweight paradox: competing explanations and analytical insights https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190521/
  </summary> 

> The analyses in Yerushalmy’s paper1 indicated that, among low birthweight infants of less than 2500 g, maternal smoking was associated with lower infant mortality. The results have been replicated in a number of studies and populations, and these seemingly paradoxical associations are now often referred to as the ‘birthweight paradox.’ As can be seen from the present set of commentaries, Yerushalmy’s paper continues to generate discussion and interest even 40 years after its publication. Several explanations have been put forward for this paradoxical association. Here we will review some of these, discuss some relations and differences between the explanations that have been proposed, and then conclude with the question of what, if anything, we can infer about the role of birthweight in governing the associations between maternal smoking and infant mortality.

> **One explanation for the birthweight paradox associations is selection or confounding bias due to conditioning on an intermediate**.2–4 If, as in Figure 1, there are unmeasured common causes (U) of low birthweight (L) and infant mortality (Y), such as for instance malnutrition or birth defects, then analyses of the association between maternal smoking (S) and infant mortality among low birthweight infants (L=1) can be in the reverse direction compared with that which one would have obtained if adjustment for U had been possible.

    Commentary: Smoking, birthweight and mortality: Jacob Yerushalmy on self-selection and the pitfalls of causal inference https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200064/
  </summary> 

> To help rule out non-causal spurious associations, **Yerushalmy urged that investigators should test for the ‘specificity’ of an association. That is, our confidence that a causal relationship is not spurious should be greater when a cause is associated with fewer effects (and vice versa).** The rationale here is that a factor which appears to be associated with many dissimilar outcomes may reflect some form of study bias. For example, statistician Joseph Berkson argued that the fact that most (88.5%) of the excess deaths among smokers in the Hammond and Horn study were not from lung cancer, but from various other causes, indicated the presence of some sort of selection bias.6

> **Those epidemiologists who argued that the evidence was sufficient at the time to call cigarette smoking a cause of lung cancer, appealed to causal criteria also, but a different set of criteria.** For example, the strength of an association was held to be important because **a strong non-causal association required a strong confounder to explain it, and weak associations were more likely to be artefacts of selection bias.** Such an obvious fact could hardly escape the attention of any conscientious investigator, the reasoning went.7 In contrast, Yerushalmy had rejected strength of association as a criterion for inference because its evaluation was necessarily subjective: ‘There is no rational way to decide how large a difference there must be before we accept it as indicating a cause-effect relationship’.8 At the same time, the lack of specificity of smoking as a cause of lung cancer was not a source of worry, according to Abraham Lilienfeld, because the association between smoking and lung cancer in particular was so dramatic relative to other adverse effects.9

    Influence of Maternal Height and Weight on Low Birth Weight: A Cross-Sectional Study in Poor Communities of Northeastern Brazil https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3823865/
  </summary> 

> A cross-sectional population-based study involving 2226 mother-child pairs was conducted during the period 2009-2010 in shantytowns of Maceió, Alagoas, Brazil. Associations between LBW and maternal sociodemographics, stature and nutritional status were investigated. The outcome variable was birth weight (< 2500g and ≥ 2500g). The independent variables were the age, income, educational background, stature and nutritional status (eutrophic, underweight, overweight and obese) of the mother. The frequency of LBW was 10%. **Short-statured mothers (1st quartile of stature ≤ 152cm) showed a tendency of increased risk of LBW children compared to mothers in the 4th quartile of stature (>160.4cm)** (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.09, p = 0.078). Children from short-statured mothers weighed an average of 125g less than those from taller mothers (3.18±0.56kg vs. 3.30±0.58kg, respectively p = 0.002). **Multivariate analyses showed that short stature, age < 20y (OR: 3.05, 95% CI:1.44 - 6.47) or were underweight (OR: 2.26, 95% CI:0.92 - 5.95) increased the risk of LBW, while overweight (OR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16 - 0.95) and obesity (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.11 - 1.31) had lower risk for LBW.** In taller mothers, lower income and underweight were associated with LBW (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07 - 3.29 and 2.85, 95% CI:1.09 - 7.47, respectively), and **obese mothers showed a trend of increased risk of LBW** (OR: 1.66, 95% CI:0.84 - 3.25).

    Maternal Age, Multiple Birth, and Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/science/article/pii/S0022347608009566?via%3Dihub
  </summary> 

> Objectives: To compare the rates of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome or death at 18 to 22 months among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants born to mothers ≥40 years to the corresponding rates among infants of younger mothers.

> Study design: Prospective evaluation of ELBW infants to quantify the relative risks of maternal age and multiple birth for death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome.

> Results: The sample consisted of 14 671 live ELBW births divided into maternal age groups: <20, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and ≥40 years. Of infants born to mothers ≥40 years, 20% were multiples. Mothers ≥40 years had high rates of obstetric interventions and medical morbidities compared with mothers <40 years. ELBW live births of mothers ≥40 years were 22% more likely to survive and had a 13% decreased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment or death compared with mothers <20. Multiple birth, however, was associated with a 10% greater risk of neurodevelopmental impairment or death.

> Conclusion: **Although mothers ≥40 years had high pregnancy-related morbidities, we found no overall increased risk of the composite outcome of death or NDI.** Multiple birth, however, was a predictor of all adverse outcomes examined, regardless of maternal age.

    Pre-pregnancy maternal BMI as predictor of neonatal birth weight https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592734/
  </summary> 

> BMI is a tool to measure maternal nutritional status. Maternal malnutrition is frequently reported health problem especially during child bearing age and effects neonatal birth weight. To determine relationship between prepregnancy maternal BMI and neonatal birth weight. Prospective, cross sectional study conducted in Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan over a period of 1 year including 2766 mother-neonate pairs. All full term, live born neonates of both gender in early neonatal period (<72 hours) with documented maternal pre-pregnancy and/or first trimester BMI were enrolled. Data analysis using SPSS version 20, was performed. Data analysis of 2766 mother-neonates pairs showed that there were 32.9% overweight and 16.5% obese mothers. More than two third of all overweight and obese mothers were of age group between 26-35 years. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, medical illness, uterine malformations and caesarean mode of delivery were more prevalent in obese mothers as 22.8%, 10.1%, 13.2%, 2.6% and 75.4% respectively. **Mean birth weight, length and OFC increased with increasing maternal BMI. Comparing for normal weight mothers, underweight mothers were at increased risk of low birth weight (p< 0.01) and low risk of macrosomic neonates (p<0.01). However overweight and obese mothers were comparable to normal weight mothers for delivering macrosomic neonates (p 0.89 and p 0.66 respectively). Our study highlights that direct relationship exists between maternal BMI and neonatal birth weight.**

  The relationship of parents' cigarette smoking to outcome of pregnancy--implications as to the problem of inferring causation from observed associations (reprint of original article) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25301860/
  </summary>

> The relationship of parents' cigarette smoking to outcome of pregnancy-implications as to the problem of inferring causation from observed associations. Amer J Epidem 1971;93:443-456. Nearly 10,000 white and more than 3000 black women were interviewed early in pregnancy on a variety of medical, genetic, environmental, and behavior variables. The increase in the incidence of low-birth-weight among infants of smoking mothers was confirmed. However, a number of paradoxical findings were observed which raise doubts as to causation. Thus, no increase in neonatal mortality was noted. Rather, the neonatal mortality rate and the risk of congenital anomalies of low-birthweight infants were considerably lower for smoking than for nonsmoking mothers. These favorable results cannot be explained by differences in gestational age, nor does a "displacement" hypothesis appear reasonable. Among other findings which could not easily be explained: The healthiest low-birth-weight infants were found for couples where the wife smoked and her husband did not smoke; the most vulnerable were produced by couples where the wife did not smoke and the husband smoked. There were great differences in mode-of-life characteristics between smokers and nonsmokers. The latter were more likely to use contraceptive methods, to plan the baby, less likely to drink coffee and hard liquor, and in general appeared to live at a much slower and moderate pace than the smokers. Most puzzling difference is that of age at menarche, which was lower for smoking mothers. These paradoxical findings raise doubts and argue against the proposition that cigarette smoking acts as an exogenous factor which interferes with intrauterine development of the fetus.

  Tobacco and Nicotine Cessation During Pregnancy -- Committee opinion by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists https://www.acog.org/en/Clinical/Clinical%20Guidance/Committee%20Opinion/Articles/2020/05/Tobacco%20and%20Nicotine%20Cessation%20During%20Pregnancy
  </summary>

> Pregnant women should be advised of the **significant perinatal risks** associated with tobacco use, including orofacial clefts, **fetal growth restriction**, placenta previa, abruptio placentae, **preterm prelabor rupture of membranes**, **low birth weight**, increased perinatal mortality, ectopic pregnancy, and decreased maternal thyroid function. Children born to women who smoke during pregnancy are at an increased risk of respiratory infections, asthma, infantile colic, bone fractures, and childhood obesity. Pregnancy influences many women to stop smoking, and approximately 54% of women who smoke before pregnancy quit smoking directly before or during pregnancy. Smoking cessation at any point in gestation benefits the pregnant woman and her fetus. The greatest benefit is observed with cessation before 15 weeks of gestation. Although cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product in pregnancy, alternative forms of tobacco use, such as e-cigarettes or vaping products, hookahs, and cigars, are increasingly common. Clinicians should advise cessation of tobacco products used in any form and provide motivational feedback. Although counseling and pregnancy-specific materials are effective cessation aids for many pregnant women, some women continue to use tobacco products. Clinicians should individualize care by offering psychosocial, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy interventions. Available cessation-aid services and resources, including digital resources, should be discussed and documented regularly at prenatal and postpartum follow-up visits.

  Yerushalmy and the problems of causal inference https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/43/5/1349/697896
  </summary> 

> Yerushalmy’s work makes worthwhile reading for the modern epidemiologist and gives insights into how erroneous causal interpretations arise. In his 1971 paper, he confirmed that smoking mothers were about twice as likely to have a low birthweight infant as non-smoking mothers. However, he also found that the neonatal mortality rate for low birthweight babies born to non-smoking mothers was higher than in mothers who smoked. Furthermore, he found that **‘the healthiest low-birth-weight infants were found for couples where the wife smoked and her husband did not smoke; the most vulnerable were produced by couples where the wife did not smoke and the husband smoked’.1 This finding, sometimes termed the ‘birthweight paradox’,2 or the ‘crossover paradox’,3 may be explained by unmeasured confounding or by different low-birthweight phenotypes.** Kramer and colleagues point out that: ‘Yerushalmy thought that the “paradox” called into question whether maternal smoking causes perinatal death’.3 Goldstein maintains that there is no ‘paradox’ but simply an inappropriate adjustment—in exploring the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality there is no justification for considering low birthweight a confounder,4 a point upon which our commentators agree.

    Young maternal age and low birth weight risk: An exploration of racial/ethnic disparities in the birth outcomes of mothers in the United States https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/science/article/pii/S0362331913001341
  </summary> 

> This study considers how low birth weight (LBW) prevalence varies by race/ethnicity and maternal age and explores mechanisms that explain disparities. Results show that maternal age patterns in LBW risk for African Americans differ from Whites and foreign- and U.S.-born Hispanics. Background socioeconomic disadvantage, together with current socioeconomic status and smoking during pregnancy, explain almost all of the LBW disparity between white teenage mothers and their older counterparts. **These findings suggest that social disadvantage is a primary driver in unfavorable birth outcomes among white teenage mothers compared to older white mothers.** Alternatively, background disadvantage and other social characteristics explain very little of the LBW disparities among African Americans and U.S.- and foreign-born Hispanics. **Overall, these results indicate LBW disparities by maternal age are a complex product of socioeconomic disadvantage and current social and behavioral factors, such that LBW risk does not operate uniformly by race/ethnicity or maternal age.**

# Project Aims and Hypothesis
**Shape your project aims and hypotheses based on reading literature, your knowledge and skills. Make sure your aims tightly connected to the project goal (i.e., association model building, and prediction model building.)**

Our research question concerns the 'Birthweight paradox', which refers to the observation made by Yerushalmy (1971) that although the incidence of low birth weight was found to be higher in smoking mother than non-smoking mothers, the mortality rate was actually found to be higher in low birth weight infants with smoking mothers compared to non-smoking mothers. VanderWeele (2014) proposed that there may be unmeasured common causes that contribute to both low birth weight and infant mortality, such that the link between low birth weight and infant mortality is actually explained by this unexplained measure and the smoking status of the mother would not necessarily be a major contributor.

We plan to evaluate the hypothesis that BMI plays a role as a confounder in the relationship between birth-weight and maternal smoking.

# Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis 

The analysis can be found here: [link](https://matthew-hoctor.github.io/BSTA512-Project/Preliminary-Analysis.html)

**Run some descriptive analysis to study distribution of the data for each variable; some exploratory analysis, see the project outline for details.**

* For descriptive analysis, you may put all values in a table.
* Then describe each variable based upon the table.
* Study distribution of each variable.
* Use transformation (e.g., gladder function in R) when needed.
* Study scatter plots (in matrix).
* Study correlation among variables (e.g., pairwise correlation matrix).
* Study higher order terms (e.g., from scatter plots, or from indicated literature you have found).
* Check normality assumption for response data.
* Check independence assumption from study design (e.g., in background study section).
* In some cases, you need to make a decision to categorize data. For example, number of cigarettes. How is it distributed? Should it be categorized? How could the categorization be done to address the current interest, e.g., non-smoker/slight smoker/moderate smoker/heavy smoker. Provide references to support the thresholds for the categorization. If there are few observations in a group, how do you make a decision to regroup it to an adjacent group, lower one or upper one?
