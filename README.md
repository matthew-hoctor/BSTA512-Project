# Getting Started

**Read carefully project outline document to see what you need to do with your project.**

**Read all support documents to understand what you can do with your project.**

**Look at the dataset to see what are available (e.g., info/variables)**

* BWT --- Birth weight measured in pounds
* GESTWKS --- Gestation measured in weeks
* MAGE --- Mother’s age measured in years
* MNOCIG --- Number of cigarettes the maternal smokes per day
* MHEIGHT --- Mother’s height measured in inches
* MPPWT --- Mother’s pre-pregnancy weight measured in pounds

**New variables to consider:**
  
* Maternal BMI & BMI category
* Smoking category

# Project Aims and Hypothesis
**Shape your project aims and hypotheses based on reading literature, your knowledge and skills. Make sure your aims tightly connected to the project goal (i.e., association model building, and prediction model building.)**

Our research question concerns the 'Birthweight paradox', which refers to the observation made by Yerushalmy (1971) that although the incidence of low birth weight was found to be higher in smoking mother than non-smoking mothers, the mortality rate was actually found to be higher in low birth weight infants with smoking mothers compared to non-smoking mothers. VanderWeele (2014) proposed that there may be unmeasured common causes that contribute to both low birth weight and infant mortality, such that the link between low birth weight and infant mortality is actually explained by this unexplained measure and the smoking status of the mother would not necessarily be a major contributor.

We plan to evaluate the hypothesis that BMI plays a role as a confounder in the relationship between birth-weight and maternal smoking.

# Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis 

The analysis can be found here: [link](https://matthew-hoctor.github.io/BSTA512-Project/Preliminary-Analysis.html)

**Run some descriptive analysis to study distribution of the data for each variable; some exploratory analysis, see the project outline for details.**

* For descriptive analysis, you may put all values in a table.
* Then describe each variable based upon the table.
* Study distribution of each variable.
* Use transformation (e.g., gladder function in R) when needed.
* Study scatter plots (in matrix).
* Study correlation among variables (e.g., pairwise correlation matrix).
* Study higher order terms (e.g., from scatter plots, or from indicated literature you have found).
* Check normality assumption for response data.
* Check independence assumption from study design (e.g., in background study section).
* In some cases, you need to make a decision to categorize data. For example, number of cigarettes. How is it distributed? Should it be categorized? How could the categorization be done to address the current interest, e.g., non-smoker/slight smoker/moderate smoker/heavy smoker. Provide references to support the thresholds for the categorization. If there are few observations in a group, how do you make a decision to regroup it to an adjacent group, lower one or upper one?
