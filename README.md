Pre-meeting brainstorming document

1. Read carefully project.outline document to see what you need to do with your project.

2. Read all support documents to understand what you can do with your project.

3. Look at the dataset to see what are available (e.g., info/variables)

- Bwt; birth weight
- Gestwks; gestational age in weeks
- Age; mother&#39;s age
- Mnocig; number of cigarettes/day smoked by the mother
- Mheight; maternal weight
- Mppweight; pre-partum weight
- New variables to consider
  - Maternal BMI &amp; BMI category
  - Smoking category

4. Do an intensive online search to find/gain knowledge about some similar/related topics through some studies. Use the resources of literature search and readings as your scientific support for your project, more particularly for your aims.

- See supporting literature below

5. Shape your project aims and hypotheses based on reading literature, your knowledge and

skills. Make sure your aims tightly connected to the project goal (i.e., association model building, and prediction model building.)

- Test hypotheses explaining &#39;Birthweight paradox&#39;
  - See notes on supporting literature below

6. Run some descriptive analysis to study distribution of the data for each variable; some exploratory analysis, see the project outline for details.

- Describe each variable
- Are data transformations necessary? (gladder function)
- Scatter plot matrix
- Check normality of response data
- Check independence assumption
- Consider categorization of variables, e.g. smoking

  - Significant perinatal risks associated with smoking
    - Preterm birth
    - Low birth weight
  - Pregnant women should be advised to quit
  - Current Obstetric consensus runs opposite of the study published on our dataset

  - Conditioning on an intermediate &quot; If we consider the low birthweight infants whose mothers do not smoke, then we know maternal smoking is ruled out as a cause for low birthweight, so that there must have been some other cause, possibly something such as malnutrition or a birth defect, the consequences of which for infant mortality are much worse.2 By not controlling for the common causes (U) of low birthweight and infant mortality, we are essentially setting up an unfair comparison between the smoking and non-smoking mothers.&quot;

However, Black women have been noted to have worse birth outcomes than White women even without consideration for variables such as smoking status and there is likely a large cluster of different factors contributing to this.)_
