# Project overview

A project overview can be found in the README.md document on the main github project page: [link](https://github.com/matthew-hoctor/BSTA512-Project)

# Import the dataset

Import the maternal smoking dataset:
```{r maternal smoking dataset, message = FALSE} 
CHDS <- read.csv("CHDS.csv")
```

# Descriptions of individual variables

## Summary statistics for each variable:

```{r}
summary(CHDS)
```

## Birth Weight plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$bwt, main = paste("Histogram of Birth Weight"), xlab = "Birth Weight (lbs)")
boxplot(CHDS$bwt, main = "Box Plot of Birth Weight", ylab = "Birth Weight (lbs)")
```

## Gestational age plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$gestwks, main = paste("Histogram of Gestational Age"), xlab = "Gestational Age (weeks)")
boxplot(CHDS$bwt, main = "Box Plot of Gestational Age", ylab = "Gestational Age (weeks)")
```

## Maternal Age plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$age, main = paste("Histogram of Maternal Age"), xlab = "Maternal Age (years)")
boxplot(CHDS$age, main = "Box Plot of Maternal Age", ylab = "Maternal Age (years)")
```

## Cigarettes smoked plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$mnocig, main = paste("Histogram of Maternal Smoking"), xlab = "Maternal Smoking (cigarettes/day)")
boxplot(CHDS$mnocig, main = "Box Plot of Maternal Smoking", ylab = "Maternal Smoking (cigarettes/day)")
```

## Maternal height plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$mheight, main = paste("Histogram of Maternal Height"), xlab = "Maternal Height (in)")
boxplot(CHDS$mheight, main = "Box Plot of Maternal Height", ylab = "Maternal Height (in)")
```

## Maternal pre-partum weight plots

```{r}
hist(CHDS$mppwt, main = paste("Histogram of Maternal Weight"), xlab = "Maternal Pre-Partum Weight (lbs)")
boxplot(CHDS$mppwt, main = "Box Plot of Maternal Weight", ylab = "Maternal Pre-Partum Weight (lbs)")
```

# Generation of new variables of interest

## BMI

The following R Code creates a new variable for body mass index from the maternal weight and pre-partum height data:

```{r}
CHDS$BMI <- 703 * CHDS$mppwt / ((CHDS$mheight)^2)
```

## BMI category

The following R code creates a new variable for BMI category:

```{r}
CHDS$BMI_cat <- 
  ifelse(CHDS$BMI < 18.5, 0, 
  ifelse(CHDS$BMI < 25, 1,
  ifelse(CHDS$BMI < 30, 2,
  ifelse(CHDS$BMI < 35, 3,
  ifelse(CHDS$BMI < 40, 4, 
  5)))))
```

Note that 0 corresponds to underweight, 1 to normal weight, 2 to overweight, 3 to class I obese, 4 to class II obese, and 5 to class III obese.

## Smoking category

The following R code creates a new variable for smoking category.  Patients are categorized as 0, non-smokers; 1, light smokers 1-9 cigarettes/day; 2, moderate smokers, 10-19 cigarettes/day; or 3, heavy smokers 20+ cigarettes/day:

```{r}
CHDS$SMK_cat <-
  ifelse(CHDS$mnocig == 0, 0,
  ifelse(CHDS$mnocig < 10, 1,
  ifelse(CHDS$mnocig < 20, 2, 
  3)))
```

## Birth weight category

# Scatter plot matrix

The following R code creates a scatter plot matrix:

```{r}
pairs(~bwt+gestwks+age+mnocig+mheight+mppwt+BMI+BMI_cat+SMK_cat, data = CHDS, main = "Scatterplot Matrix")
```

# Check normality of response data

## Birth Weight

We can perform the Shapiro-Wilk test to to test for normality:

```{r}
shapiro.test(CHDS$bwt)
```

This borderline p-value suggests that more investigation may be needed.  A Q-Q plot and boxplot may help:

```{r}
qqnorm(CHDS$bwt)
boxplot(CHDS$bwt)
```

These results suggest that birth weight is normally distributed. For completeness we can check the gladder function:

```{r}
gladder(CHDS$bwt)
```

None of the transformed distributions look particularly better than the origional distribution.

## Gestational Age

We can perform the Shapiro-Wilk test to to test for normality:

```{r}
shapiro.test(CHDS$gestwks)

gladder(CHDS$gestwks)
```

This is very consistent with normal distribution.  We will do a Q-Q plot and boxplot for completeness:

```{r}
qqnorm(CHDS$gestwks)
boxplot(CHDS$gestwks)
```

These results suggest that gestational age is normally distributed.

# Preliminary Exploratory analysis

The following code evaluates the the correlation coefficients for each of the variables used in the study:
```{r}
pcor(CHDS)$estimate
```

Note that from the above output that the magnitude of the correlation of `bwt` with `mppwt` and `BMI` are almost as large as the magnitude of the correlation of `bwt` with `mcnocig`. Also worth noting is the magnitude of the correlation between `bwt` and `gestwks`, although this is not unexpected since birthweight is well documented to be associated with gestation age with much higher risk of low birth weight among pre-term infants. 

## Birth-weight and gestation weeks

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$gestwks))
```

The output above shows that there is very highly statistically significant evidence (P < 0.001) for a linear relationship between `bwt` and `gestwks`.

## Birth-weight and age

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$age))
```

The output above shows there is insufficient evidence (P = 0.9729) to suggest a linear relationship between birth-weight and age.

## Birth-weight and cigarettes smoked per day

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$mnocig))
```

The output above shows that there is very highly statistically significant evidence (P < 0.001) that there is a linear association between birthweight and number of cigarettes smoked per day by the mother.

## Birth-weight and maternal height

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$mheight))
```

The output above shows that there is very highly statistically significant evidence (P < 0.001) that there is a linear association between birthweight and maternal height.

## Birth-weight and maternal pre-pregnancy weight

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$mppwt))
```

The output above shows that there is very highly statistically significant evidence (P < 0.001) for a linear association between birthweight and maternal pre-pregnancy weight.

## Birth-weight and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$BMI))
```

The output above shows that there is very highly statistically significant evidence (P < 0.001) for a linear association between birthweight and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.

## Birth-weight and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI with cigarettes smoked as control

```{r}
summary(lm(CHDS$bwt ~ CHDS$BMI + CHDS$mnocig))
```

Including `mnocig` in the model still provides significant evidence for the `BMI` correlation coefficient (0.001 < P < 0.01), although the magnitude of the coefficient has decreased slightly, from 0.05262 to 0.049132. The R^2^ value for the model including both `BMI` and `mnocig` in the model is slightly higher than for when `BMI` is used alone, increasing from 0.01602 to 0.04612.
