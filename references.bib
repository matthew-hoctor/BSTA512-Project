	abstract = {The Institute of Medicine recommends that short women gain less weight during pregnancy than taller women in order to reduce the risk of high birthweight, which can lead to feto-pelvic disproportion. This recommendation, however, is based on clinical judgment rather than on epidemiologic evidence, as few studies have examined the relationships between maternal height, pregnancy weight gain, and infant birthweight. Our objective was to determine whether maternal height is an independent risk factor for infant birthweight and to assess whether maternal height modifies the effect of pregnancy weight gain on infant birthweight. We examined the relationship between maternal height and infant birthweight in a multi-ethnic cohort of 8,870 women with uncomplicated pregnancies who delivered singleton infants at the University of California, San Francisco, 1980-1990. Using multiple linear regression, we modeled the contribution of height and weight gain to birthweight in four different ethnic groups. Increasing maternal height was significantly and positively associated with infant birthweight in White, Black, and Asian women, but not Hispanic women. The relationship between pregnancy weight gain and infant birthweight was not modified by maternal height. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 12:682-687, 2000. Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators.

Analyses included 1867 singleton livebirths to women enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort.

	abstract = {At {IJE} we see a steady flow of manuscripts submitted for consideration that demonstrate smoking kills. We surely know enough about the harmful effects of smoking to support policies to protect the health of the public? So why have we chosen to reprint a paper published by Jacob Yerushalmy over 40 years ago, on the effects of parental smoking on neonatal mortality?1Yerushalmy’s work makes worthwhile reading for the modern epidemiologist and gives insights into how erroneous causal interpretations arise. In his 1971 paper, he confirmed that smoking mothers were about twice as likely to have a low birthweight infant as non-smoking mothers. However, he also found that the neonatal mortality rate for low birthweight babies born to non-smoking mothers was higher than in mothers who smoked. Furthermore, he found that ‘the healthiest low-birth-weight infants were found for couples where the wife smoked and her husband did not smoke; the most vulnerable were produced by couples where the wife did not smoke and the husband smoked’.1 This finding, sometimes termed the ‘birthweight paradox’,2 or the ‘crossover paradox’,3 may be explained by unmeasured confounding or by different low-birthweight phenotypes. Kramer and colleagues point out that: ‘Yerushalmy thought that the “paradox” called into question whether maternal smoking causes perinatal death’.3 Goldstein maintains that there is no ‘paradox’ but simply an inappropriate adjustment—in exploring the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality there is no justification for considering low birthweight a confounder,4 a point upon which our commentators agree.},

	abstract = {The relationship of parents' cigarette smoking to outcome of pregnancy-implications as to the problem of inferring causation from observed associations. Amer J Epidem 1971;93:443-456. Nearly 10,000 white and more than 3000 black women were interviewed early in pregnancy on a variety of medical, genetic, environmental, and behavior variables. The increase in the incidence of low-birth-weight among infants of smoking mothers was confirmed. However, a number of paradoxical findings were observed which raise doubts as to causation. Thus, no increase in neonatal mortality was noted. Rather, the neonatal mortality rate and the risk of congenital anomalies of low-birthweight infants were considerably lower for smoking than for nonsmoking mothers. These favorable results cannot be explained by differences in gestational age, nor does a "displacement" hypothesis appear reasonable. Among other findings which could not easily be explained: The healthiest low-birth-weight infants were found for couples where the wife smoked and her husband did not smoke; the most vulnerable were produced by couples where the wife did not smoke and the husband smoked. There were great differences in mode-of-life characteristics between smokers and nonsmokers. The latter were more likely to use contraceptive methods, to plan the baby, less likely to drink coffee and hard liquor, and in general appeared to live at a much slower and moderate pace than the smokers. Most puzzling difference is that of age at menarche, which was lower for smoking mothers. These paradoxical findings raise doubts and argue against the proposition that cigarette smoking acts as an exogenous factor which interferes with intrauterine development of the fetus.},

Children born to women who smoke during pregnancy are at an increased risk of respiratory infections, asthma, infantile colic, bone fractures, and childhood obesity. Pregnancy influences many women to stop smoking, and approximately 54\% of women who smoke before pregnancy quit smoking directly before or during pregnancy. Smoking cessation at any point in gestation benefits the pregnant woman and her fetus. The greatest benefit is observed with cessation before 15 weeks of gestation. Although cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product in pregnancy, alternative forms of tobacco use, such as e-cigarettes or vaping products, hookahs, and cigars, are increasingly common. Clinicians should advise cessation of tobacco products used in any form and provide motivational feedback. Although counseling and pregnancy-specific materials are effective cessation aids for many pregnant women, some women continue to use tobacco products. Clinicians should individualize care by offering psychosocial, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy interventions. Available cessation-aid services and resources, including digital resources, should be discussed and documented regularly at prenatal and postpartum follow-up visits.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study compares patterns of tobacco use during pregnancy over time and across population subgroups and examines the impact of maternal smoking on the incidence of low birth weight ({LBW}). The study also evaluates the use of birth certificates to monitor prenatal smoking.
{METHODS}: The birth certificates of all states (except California) and the District of Columbia for 2000 provided to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics were analyzed. Trends in maternal smoking were examined with data from birth certificates and other relevant sources.
{RESULTS}: Smoking during pregnancy was reported for 12.2\% of women who gave birth in 2000, down 37\% from 1989 (19.5\%), when this information was first collected on birth certificates. Throughout the 1990s, prenatal smoking rates were highest for older teenagers and women in their early 20s. Among population subgroups, the highest rates were reported for non-Hispanic white women who attended but did not complete high school. The incidence of {LBW} among singleton infants who were born to smokers was double that for nonsmokers. This relationship was observed in all age groups, for births to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white and black women, and within educational attainment subgroups. Even light smoking ({\textless}5 cigarettes daily) was associated with elevated rates of {LBW}.
{CONCLUSION}: Although prenatal smoking may be underreported on the birth certificate, the trends and variations in smoking based on birth certificate data have been confirmed with data from other sources. Birth certificate data can be useful in monitoring prenatal smoking patterns. Changes in the birth certificate questions that are to be implemented beginning in 2003 will help to clarify the levels and changes in smoking behavior during pregnancy so that smoking cessation programs can be more effectively designed to meet the needs of the populations at risk.},

	abstract = {Background
Low birthweight ({LBW}) of less than 2500 g is an important marker of maternal and fetal health, predicting mortality, stunting, and adult-onset chronic conditions. Global nutrition targets set at the World Health Assembly in 2012 include an ambitious 30\% reduction in {LBW} prevalence between 2012 and 2025. Estimates to track progress towards this target are lacking; with this analysis, we aim to assist in setting a baseline against which to assess progress towards the achievement of the World Health Assembly targets.

Methods
We sought to identify all available {LBW} input data for livebirths for the years 2000–16. We considered population-based national or nationally representative datasets for inclusion if they contained information on birthweight or {LBW} prevalence for livebirths. A new method for survey adjustment was developed and used. For 57 countries with higher quality time-series data, we smoothed country-reported trends in birthweight data by use of B-spline regression. For all other countries, we estimated {LBW} prevalence and trends by use of a restricted maximum likelihood approach with country-level random effects. Uncertainty ranges were obtained through bootstrapping. Results were summed at the regional and worldwide level.

Findings
We collated 1447 country-years of birthweight data (281 million births) for 148 countries of 195 {UN} member states (47 countries had no data meeting inclusion criteria). The estimated worldwide {LBW} prevalence in 2015 was 14·6\% (uncertainty range [{UR}] 12·4–17·1) compared with 17·5\% (14·1–21·3) in 2000 (average annual reduction rate [{AARR}] 1·23\%). In 2015, an estimated 20·5 million ({UR} 17·4–24·0 million) livebirths were {LBW}, 91\% from low-and-middle income countries, mainly southern Asia (48\%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24\%).

Interpretation
Although these estimates suggest some progress in reducing {LBW} between 2000 and 2015, achieving the 2·74\% {AARR} required between 2012 and 2025 to meet the global nutrition target will require more than doubling progress, involving both improved measurement and programme investments to address the causes of {LBW} throughout the lifecycle.

{OBJECTIVE}: To examine neurosensory, developmental, and medical conditions together with the associated functional limitations and special health care needs of {ELBW} children compared with normal-birth-weight ({NBW}) term-born children (controls).
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: A follow-up study at age 8 years of a cohort of 219 {ELBW} children born 1992 to 1995 (92\% of survivors) and 176 {NBW} controls of similar sociodemographic status conducted in Cleveland, Ohio.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Parent Questionnaire for Identifying Children with Chronic Conditions of 12 months or more and categorization of specific medical diagnoses and developmental disabilities based on examination of the children.
{RESULTS}: In logistic regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic status and sex, {ELBW} children had significantly more chronic conditions than {NBW} controls, including functional limitations (64\% vs 20\%, respectively; odds ratio [{OR}], 8.1; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 5.0-13.1; P{\textless}.001), compensatory dependency needs (48\% vs 23\%, respectively; {OR}, 3.0; 95\% {CI}, 1.9-4.7; P{\textless}.001), and services above those routinely required by children (65\% vs 27\%, respectively; {OR}, 5.4; 95\% {CI}, 3.4-8.5; P{\textless}.001). These differences remained significant when the 36 {ELBW} children with neurosensory impairments were excluded. Specific diagnoses and disabilities for {ELBW} vs {NBW} children included cerebral palsy (14\% vs 0\%, respectively; P{\textless}.001), asthma (21\% vs 9\%; {OR}, 3.0; 95\% {CI}, 1.6-5.6; P = .001), vision of less than 20/200 (10\% vs 3\%; {OR}, 3.1; 95\% {CI}, 1.2-7.8; P = .02), low {IQ} of less than 85 (38\% vs 14\%; {OR}, 4.5; 95\% {CI}, 2.7-7.7; P{\textless}.001), limited academic skills (37\% vs 15\%; {OR}, 4.2; 95\% {CI}, 2.5-7.3; P{\textless}.001), poor motor skills (47\% vs 10\%; {OR}, 7.8; 95\% {CI}, 4.5-13.6; P{\textless}.001), and poor adaptive functioning (69\% vs 34\%; {OR}, 6.5; 95\% {CI}, 4.0-10.6; P{\textless}.001).

However, the relationship between maternal height and birth outcomes remains unclear. We examined the effect of shorter maternal height on low birth weight ({LBW}) among 17,150 pairs of Japanese mothers and newborns. Data for this analysis were collected from newborns who were delivered at a large hospital in Japan. Maternal height was the exposure variable, and {LBW} and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit were the outcome variables. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations. The shortest maternal height quartile (131.0–151.9 cm) was related to {LBW} ({OR} 1.91 [95\% {CI} 1.64, 2.22]). The groups with the second (152.0–157.9 cm) and the third shortest maternal height quartiles (158.0–160.9 cm) were also related to {LBW}. A P trend with one quartile change also showed a significant relationship. The relationship between maternal height and {NICU} admission disappeared when the statistical model was adjusted for {LBW}. A newborn’s small size was one factor in the relationship between shorter maternal height and {NICU} admission. In developed countries, shorter mothers provide a useful prenatal target to anticipate and plan for {LBW} newborns and {NICU} admission.,},

	abstract = {Purpose
Smoking during pregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk of small for gestational age ({SGA}) and low birth weight, while elevated prepregnancy body mass index ({BMI}) is associated with a decreased risk of {SGA} and higher birth weight. We investigated the combined effect of prenatal smoking and prepregnancy {BMI} on risk of {SGA} and on birth weight.

Methods
A total of 34,928 singleton, term pregnancies in residents of New York City between 1995 and 2003 were evaluated in multivariable regression models of birth weight and risk of {SGA}.

Results
Increasing prepregnancy {BMI} reduced the risk of {SGA} and increased birth weight. The effect of prenatal smoking on birth weight and {SGA} diminished in women as their prepregnancy {BMI} increased, such that prenatal smoking did not significantly impact the risk of {SGA} among women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy. Prenatal smoking decreased mean birth weight by 187 grams (95\% confidence interval ({CI}): -337, -37) among underweight women, by 129 grams (95\% {CI}: -170, -87) among normal weight women, by 46 grams (95\% {CI}: -113, +20) among overweight women, and by 75 grams (95\% {CI}: -162, +11) among obese women.

Conclusions
This study suggests that the effect of smoking during pregnancy on {SGA} and birth weight is present in underweight and normal weight women but markedly reduced among obese and overweight women.},

{BMI} is a tool to measure maternal nutritional status. Maternal malnutrition is frequently reported health problem especially during child bearing age and effects neonatal birth weight.

Aim
To determine relationship between prepregnancy maternal {BMI} and neonatal birth weight.

Methods and material
Prospective, cross sectional study conducted in Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan over a period of 1 year including 2766 mother—neonate pairs. All full term, live born neonates of both gender in early neonatal period ({\textless}72 hours) with documented maternal pre-pregnancy and/or first trimester {BMI} were enrolled. Data analysis using {SPSS} version 20, was performed.

Results
Data analysis of 2766 mother–neonates pairs showed that there were 32.9\% overweight and 16.5\% obese mothers. More than two third of all overweight and obese mothers were of age group between 26–35 years. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, medical illness, uterine malformations and caesarean mode of delivery were more prevalent in obese mothers as 22.8\%, 10.1\%, 13.2\%, 2.6\% and 75.4\% respectively. Mean birth weight, length and {OFC} increased with increasing maternal {BMI}. Comparing for normal weight mothers, underweight mothers were at increased risk of low birth weight (p{\textless} 0.01) and low risk of macrosomic neonates (p{\textless}0.01). However overweight and obese mothers were comparable to normal weight mothers for delivering macrosomic neonates (p 0.89 and p 0.66 respectively).

Conclusions
Our study highlights that direct relationship exists between maternal {BMI} and neonatal birth weight.},

	abstract = {Maternal smoking has been found to adversely affect birth outcomes, such as increasing the odds of having low birth weight infants. However, the mechanisms explaining how a mother’s smoking is linked to a child’s low birth weight status are underexplored. This study merged two nationally representative datasets in the United States ({US})—the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 ({NLSY}79) and the {NLSY}79 Child and Young Adult ({NLSYCYA})—to examine whether maternal weight status before pregnancy serves as a biological mechanism. We applied a recently developed mediation analysis technique to a data sample of 6550 mother–child pairs, and we compared the estimated coefficients across nested probability models. We found that maternal body mass index ({BMI}) (in kg/m2), a widely used measure of weight status, reduces the odds of delivering a low birth weight infant, and this mechanism explains about 10.2\% of the adverse impact of maternal smoking on having a low birth weight child. Moreover, when categorizing maternal pre-pregnancy {BMI} into four weight statuses (i.e., underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese), we found that, in contrast to mothers with normal weight status, underweight mothers are 70\% more likely to have a low birth weight child. Our findings suggest that maternal weight status plays a role in understanding how maternal smoking affects low birth weight outcome, indicating that maintaining a proper weight status for women who plan to give birth may be a possible policy to promote infant health.},

To compare the rates of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome or death at 18 to 22 months among extremely low birth weight ({ELBW}) infants born to mothers ≥ 40 years to the corresponding rates among infants of younger mothers.

Study Design
Prospective evaluation of {ELBW} infants to quantify the relative risks of maternal age and multiple birth for death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome.

Results
The sample consisted of 14,671 live {ELBW} births divided into maternal age groups: {\textless}20; 20–29; 30–39; and ≥ 40 years. Of infants born to mothers ≥ 40 years, 20\% were multiples. Mothers ≥ 40 years had high rates of obstetrical interventions and medical morbidities compared to mothers {\textless} 40 years. {ELBW} live births of mothers ≥ 40 years were 22 \% more likely to survive and had a 13\% decreased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment or death compared to mothers{\textless} 20. Multiple birth, however, was associated with a 10 \% greater risk or neurodevelopmental impairment or death.

Conclusion
Although mothers ≥ 40 years had high pregnancy related morbidities, we found no overall increased risk of the composite outcome of death or {NDI}. Multiple birth, however, was a predictor of all adverse outcomes examined, regardless of maternal age.},

Data are presented for maternal age, live-birth order, race and Hispanic origin, marital status, attendant at birth, method of delivery, period of gestation, birthweight, and plurality. Birth and fertility rates are presented by age, live-birth order, race and Hispanic origin, and marital status. Selected data by mother's state of residence and birth rates by age and race of father also are shown. Trends in fertility patterns and maternal and infant characteristics are described and interpreted.
METHODS: Descriptive tabulations of data reported on the birth certificates of the 3.93 million U.S. births that occurred in 2013 are presented.
RESULTS: A total of 3,932,181 births were registered in the United States in 2013, down less than 1\% from 2012. The general fertility rate declined to 62.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. The teen birth rate fell 10\%, to 26.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-19. Birth rates declined for women in their 20s and increased for most age groups of women aged 30 and over. The total fertility rate (estimated number of births over a woman's lifetime) declined 1\% to 1,857.5 per 1,000 women. Measures of unmarried childbearing were down in 2013 from 2012. The cesarean delivery rate declined to 32.7\%. The preterm birth rate declined for the seventh straight year to 11.39\%, but the low birthweight rate was essentially unchanged at 8.02\%. The twin birth rate rose 2\% to 33.7 per 1,000 births; the triplet and higher-order multiple birth rate dropped 4\% to 119.5 per 100,000 total births.},
